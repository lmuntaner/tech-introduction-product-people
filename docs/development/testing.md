# Testing

## What is Testing

Testing is the process to check that a software performs the tasks that is supposed to perform.

This means that someone or something is executing your program and trying it out.

By the end of the testing phase, the software is supposed to be without defects -that is never the case- and ready to be used.

The tests can be performed by a human or by another computer program.

## Why is it important

Software bugs can be very expensive for a company. Having a good set of tests is crucial to ensure that the software is doing what it's supposed to be doing.

Another important reason is the peace of mind for the developers. Software projects are a complex system and a change in one place might have unexpected behavior in another part of the project.

By having proper tests, the developers can check whether the rest of the project works as expected after their change.

## Automated tests

We said earlier that tests can be executed by a person or either by another program.

When the tests are executed by another program they are also called **Automated Tests**.

This means that we can easily execute this *testing program* to check whether our project behaves as expected.

You are using software to test another software.

Usually it is the same developer that wrote the functionality that will also write the tests for that functionality. It means that the developer that wrote the code, also writes the code to test the code -Brain Exploding!-.
