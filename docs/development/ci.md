# Continuous Integration

## What is Continuos Integration

Also known as CI.

CI is a best practice when developing software.

The idea is that the master branch of the project is always up to date. As well as the developer local copies of the project are frequently synched.

This means that a developer should not work on a functionality for one week or more without merging it to master.

Developers should work in small tasks. These tasks are always reviewed and merge into the master branch.

This is also related to executing the tests for the project after each functionality is added to master.

Some projects might not allow to merge code if the tests don't pass.

Some teams go further and do not allow any new functionality to be merged without new tests. This ensures that any new functionality added will have it's own tests.
