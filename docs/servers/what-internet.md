# What is the Internet

The Internet is a lot of computer connected together.

According to Wikipedia:

> The Internet (contraction of interconnected network) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.

It is a network of networks. Millions of computers are connected.

However, they all have *agreed* on *how* to talk to each other. The *how*s are called protocols.

One of the most amazing and important thing of the Internet, is that there is not a single source of data. Or a centralized computer where everything is orchestrated.

Each computer is independent. They just need to be connected to this huge network using one of this protocols and that's it.

## World Wide Web

The Internet is this huge network of network of computers. What we access everyday is the World Wide Web.

You are reading this probably through the World Wide Web (www for short).

The World Wide Web is a subset of all the Internet. It is a specific way of accessing information on it.

Specifically, the World Wide Web uses the HTTP protocol to connect the computers together.

In the WWW the main target was to share information. Facilitate the sharing of information among scientists what the main goal of creating the World Wide Web.

The computers connected to the WWW have all a specific address in the form of a URL or Uniform Resource Locator.

As an example of what is NOT the WWW we have email services, which go over the protocol SMTP, or sharing of files with the protocol of FTP.

## TCP/IP Protocol

A protocol is just a standard agreed between two devices on *how* to share the information.

TCP/IP or Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol are these foundational protocols that all the other protocols on the Internet need to follow.

Initially it was a project by the US Department of Defense through their research center DARPA.

This foundations are very important. In the end, computer are connected only through cables. Physically, what can be sent though the cables is just electricity.

Remember how computers only understand 1s and 0s and then through layers of standards and abstractions (ASCII, RGB, ...) they are able to show fancy things on a screen.

Similarly, two computers connected to each other can only share electricity. Also 1s and 0s. However, through layers of standards and abstractions they are able to share 1s and 0s that represent text and images.

An example of protocols built on top of the TCP/IP protocol are:

* Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
* File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
* Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

## Fun fact

Adding `www` to the URLs was never mandatory, it was just customary: [Link](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-technical-reason-you-needed-www-prefix-to-reach-a-website-but-it-seems-that-today-it-doesnt-matter)
