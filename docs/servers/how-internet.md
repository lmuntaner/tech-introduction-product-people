# How does it work:

the browser need to know the numerical IP address. DNS lookup
1. Browser DNS cache 2. OS cache 3. Call DNS server which local router/ ISP router

browser sends a HTTP request to the web server

server then responds

browser to render the response content as HTML

browser begins rendering the HTML and sends more requests

## Client to server model

Structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients

A client does not share any of its resources

Clients therefore initiate communication sessions with servers which await incoming requests

Examples: email, networking printing, world wide web

## Peer-to-peer model

distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application.

Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants

without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts.

Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources

## DNS

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet

it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses

it serves as the phone book for the Internet by translating human-friendly computer hostnames into IP addresses

## Fun fact

DNS started as a text file in The Stanford Research Institute.

Addresses were assigned manually contacting the center by phone.
