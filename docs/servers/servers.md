## What is a Server

A Server is a computer connected to the Internet that will share information with the *Client to Server* model.

It is important to understand that a server is just a computer. Any computer could be a server.

However, computers that are used as servers have been built specifically for that purpose. For example, they don't need a screen.

There are different kind of servers: database server, file servers, print servers, web servers, ...

Remember that the main job of the task of a server is to send information when requested.

A server has a running program at all times *listening* for this incoming requests and sending back the information.

Imagine creating a program with a `while` loop that never finishes. It's always running. This is the kind of program running on a server.

*The term server is also referred to this running process.*

**A server does NOT need to be connected to the Internet.** It can be connected to a company's internal network.
