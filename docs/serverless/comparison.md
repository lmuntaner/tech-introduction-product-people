# Comparison

Table comparison of the responsibilities of the team developing an application depending on the architecture they decide to implement:

Layers | On Premise Data Center | Shared Data Center | Cloud Computing | FaaS
---- | ---- | ---- | ----
Investment in hardware | yes | no | no | no
Maintenance of hardware | yes | no | no | no
Scale hardware | yes | yes | no | no
Setup hardware | yes | yes | no | no
Setup application environment | yes | yes | yes | no
Setup application | yes | yes | yes | no
Manage dependencies | yes | yes | yes | yes
Execute task | yes | yes | yes | yes

That the team developing is not taking care of those functions doesn't mean that no one is.

What is actually happening is that the tendency is to move this responsibility towards the infrastructure providers.

**Servelerss does NOT mean without servers.**

It means that your team does not handle servers.
