# Virtual Machines

A Virtual Machine or VM acts like a real computer, but it is not a real computer.

You can have more than one VM running in a computer at the same time.

The applications running in a VM know nothing about not running in a VM or directly in a computer.

You can even install a different Operating System within your VM than the one used in the actual computer.

An important part of VMs is that when you create one, you select how many resources from the original computer will be used for that VM.

A simple example, let's say we have one computer with 1 Gigabyte of storage. If we want to run 4 VMs we would probably split 250Mb on each VM.

This means that each VM can only use 250Mb of storage. Even if another VM is not using all its 250Mb, the other cannot use this extra space.
