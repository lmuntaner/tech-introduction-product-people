# Software

## Definition

What we call Software are the collection of instructions that are executed in a computer.

Example of software are operating systems, computer programs and libraries.

Software is written in a specific programming language by a human. This then gets "translated" to a set of instructions for the machine.

## Operating Systems

It is the software that manages the hardware and other software resources. It provides common services for computer programs.

The layer between the hardware and the software that other people develop.

Examples of OS: Windows, MacOS, Ubuntu and MS-DOS

### Interface

A user can interact with the OS, with different interfaces

* A GUI or Graphical User Interface. Most common way for most people.
* The Terminal. Text and command way of navigating and performing actions.

The Terminal is used a lot for developers to perform a wide set of tasks. From navigatingn folders to starting up a server.

## Computer Program

Software that performs a very specific task. For example a Chrome, Excel, Skype, ...

They are also called Desktop Applications. Or in general referred to as Computer Software.

These are build on top of the Operating System. Usually used by humans.

## Libraries

Whereas a Computer Program is meant to perform a task by a human, a library is a piece of software mean to be used by a Software Developer.

Libraries are used to develop a Computer Program or other libraries.

It's like Lego, once you have built a house, you can use it in another place. They are the building blocks.

Unlike in Lego, libraries are extremely easy to reproduce. The developer only needs to copy paste the text.

## Open Source

Once a developer has created the tasks to perform a task, it could allow other developers to use his code. So that they don't need to waste time solving the same issues that he has already solved.

This piece of software available to use for anyone is called an Open Source software.

Any developer uses in his daily job Open Source software at the moment.

In order to build a website or a server, you might be using only one library. However, that library probably relies on many more libraries. Which in turn rely on other libraries.

These create a set of dependencies hard to keep track of.

It is amazing the amount of faith and altruism in Open Source projects. It has sometimes backfired, but the idea of stop using Open Source is not an option anymore.
