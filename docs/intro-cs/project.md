# Project: Introduction to Computer Science

## Exercises

The exercises you are going to perform are [here]().

Download the file and solve them

## Node Environment

First of all try to run them from the terminal with `node`.

### Create a Node Project

Before being able to use a package, you need to create a Node Project in your folder.

Open the terminal. Navigate to the folder. You should ONLY have the `js` file in that folder for now.

In the terminal, run `npm init -y`.

You will see how this created a file called `package.json`.

### Install a library for the project

If you want to add a library, you can now do so with `npm install <library>`.

For the project you can run this:

```shell
npm install luxon
```

This will change your `package.json`, add a folder called `node_modules` and -depending on your node version- create a `package-lock.json`.

### Use the library

To use the library you need to import in your file.

```javascript
var { DateTime } = require('luxon');

// Test whether it's working
console.log(DateTime.local());
```

## Browser environment

Your job now is to try and execute the same file in a browser.

Create a new folder and copy the `exercises.js` file there.

You will need an HTML file with at least the minimum structure required.

Add a script tag in it:

```html
<script src="./exercises.js"></script>
```

Open your HTML file with the browser.

Open the Dev Tools Console in your browser. Right click inside the blank page, then choose `Inspect` or whatever that is in your language.

Or just google `Open console with Chrome / Firefox / Edge`.

If you have copy pasted the code. You should see an error.

Something like this. Probably in red letters ðŸ˜±

> Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined

Try to find out WHY there is the error and fix it.
