# Pattern Library

Also known as Component Library or Design Patterns.

## What is it

A pattern library is a set of user interface components.

They are recurring solutions to design problems.

These solutions or components appear multiple times in the application. For example:

* Navigation
* Social Media features
* Media Content
* Slideshows

The pattern library documents all this elements and defines how they should behave and when to use them.

Examples of pattern libraries:

* [Mailchimp](https://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns/buttons)
* [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/category/design-patterns)

## Why to use a pattern library

The advantages are very similar to the advantages of using a style guide.

### Consistency

A pattern library ensures a consistent user interface across multiple pages and projects.

### Cost efficiency

Well documented and reusable code is a fantastic tool to increase productivity in development.

### Better maintenance

Working on somebody else's code is easier when everybody uses the same components.

## Pattern Library vs Style Guide

The main difference between a pattern library and a style guide are the level of their standards.

A style guide focuses more on the foundations of the user interface. Which colors, icons, margins, fonts...

A pattern library focuses on a higher level. How to tell the user that something is clickable. Or how to show him a nice set of pictures.

They both offer standards to user interfaces but at different levels of abstraction.
