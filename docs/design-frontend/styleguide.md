## What is a Style Guide

A Style Guide is a set of standards for writing and creating documents.

It applies to any kind of document, not just websites. It can also be applied to brands, marketing or other corporate communication.

We will focus on style guide as the standards to create a user interface for our website or application.

It is also known as Materials or Foundations.

It refers to rules for some of the following topics:

* Colour
* Icons
* Margins
* Padding
* Typography
* Grids

Check out the [Foundations](https://atlassian.design/guidelines/product/foundations/color) from [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) for a good example.

[Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/static/reference/styleguide/) has also a nice style guide.

A style guide is not a static document. It is a living organism that evolves with the product.

It takes time to have a well documented style guide. The bigger the team and project is the more advantages it has.

## Why use a Style Guide

### Consistency

A good style guide ensures consistency across pages and/or projects.

With more than one team and more than one member working on the same product, it would be very easy to start having inconsistencies.

### Efficiency

With a style guide, team members don't need to think every time on which decisions to make.

This allows for a faster development.

### New members onboarding

When a new member joins a team it always takes some time to get him or her up to speed.

Having a well documented style guide improves the onboarding process.

## Style Guide vs Style Guide

A style guide can also refer to HOW to write CSS or any programming language. Not just colors, typography.

For example, a style guide for Javascript would set the rule to always use 2 spaces instead of 4. Or use camel-case `variableName` naming convention instead of snake-case `variable_name`.
