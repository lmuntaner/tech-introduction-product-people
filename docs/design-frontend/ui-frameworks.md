# UI Frameworks

## What is it

We could consider UI frameworks as open source pattern libraries already developed and ready to use.

Not all of them are open source, but most of them.

They are usually related to a specific frontend framework such as React or VueJS.

Some companies go further than just documenting their pattern libraries. They also publishing and open source them.

An example is [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) and its [Blueprint JS](https://blueprintjs.com/) library.

Other companies might publish only their pattern libraries and style guides. Then other people might take them and create a library out of that.

An example is Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/design/) and the React library [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).

There are also open source projects supported either by the community, one single company or a set of companies:

* [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)
* [Element](https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US)
* [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com)

The list goes on and on and on.

UI Frameworks can be customized using themes. Themes help customize the library to your projects needs, but up to a point.

## Why to use one

There is one single and most important reason. FASTER DEVELOPMENT.

Using a UI Framework saves a lot of time for developers and designers.

Even a team of developers can get far away in terms of UI by deciding to use a UI Framework instead of creating their own.

## Why not

You should only use a UI framework when the design of your application or page follows the same standards.

You can customize the library to your needs with a theme. However, there are limitations to that customization.

Each library is different in what can or cannot be customized. Customizing colors and fonts is always straightforward.

If your elements are much different than the libraries implementation, it might not be worth the effort to use the library.
