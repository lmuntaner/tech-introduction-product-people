# Project

## Project setup

You are going to write Documentation for the engineers of Windows 95!

There is already a [project setup](https://github.com/lmuntaner/docz-windows95) for you.

Go ahead, clone the repo, read the README and run it.

## Introduction

You will be using a tool called [Docz](https://www.docz.site/) for the documentation.

The project uses React as a frontend framework. You will learn a little bit how to use React Components.

```javascript
import { Button } from '../components'

//...

<Button>Click Me</Button>
```

A React Component is used as if it was an HTML tag. You have the opening `<Button>` and the closing `</Button>`.

They also can have attributes. Same as an HTML tag has. In React they are called Props.

## Improve documentation

The components you need to document are inside the folder `components`.

There is already some documentation [here](https://arturbien.github.io/React95/?path=/story/button--default).

Your task is to improve that documentation.

### Single Component Documentation

Follow the example used in `docs/button.mdx`.

There should be more examples with the different props you can use the Button with. As well as some explanations.

### Document all the components

You should now do the same for all the components in the folders `components`.

Read the [old documentation](https://arturbien.github.io/React95/?path=/story/button--default) to help you. Sometimes you need to use the components together to make them usable.
