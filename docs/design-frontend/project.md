# Project

## Component Documentation

use https://www.docz.site/

setup a project for them

How about creating a folder with plenty of components and they need to create the documentation for them.

Or just create the documentation for some component library.

They could use those individual components to create more complex components and document them.

Maybe document how to build a Card, a Feed Item, ...

Create the document for the client. Explaining why we chose the components that were chosen.
