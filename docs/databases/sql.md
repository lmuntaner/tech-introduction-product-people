# Structured Query Language or SQL

## What is SQL

SQL is a domain-specific language.

Relational databases are managed by systems called Relational Database Management System or RDBMS.

To interact with a RDBMS you need to use SQL language. With SQL you can perform all the CRUD operations in your database.

## Syntax

SQL works with statements. Each statement can perform one or more actions.

A SQL statement is divided into smaller parts which are clauses.

Here you have an example from Wikipedia:

Within your clauses you have predicates. Within predicates you write expressions.

In a nutshell:

Statement -> Clauses -> Predicates -> Expressions

### Queries

A query is the most common statement. It is a statement to read data.
