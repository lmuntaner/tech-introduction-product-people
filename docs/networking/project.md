# Project

This module's project is a game. I hope you enjoy it.

The game is an API server that exposes a couple of endpoints to interact with.

You will need to send requests and read the responses to play.

You have to win using different tools to interact with the server.

## Use Postman

I recommend you to start playing with [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).

It is a tool with a very nice GUI to send customized requests.

## Use curl

Try with the cli tool [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)

## Use a javascript file

Make the requests by executing a javascript file.

To make the requests with Javascript you might want to use an npm package such as [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) or [request](https://github.com/request/request).

For this part it's ok to change the code every time and only do one request in the file and read the response.

## Optional: Create a bot to play

If you feel adventurous you could create a javascript program that plays the game.

This program would have to make a request, read the response, and based on the response, decided which next request to make.

THIS IS HARD!

It is a good exercise to give you an idea of how to interact with an API server with code.
