## What is it

It is a format to exchange information.

It is used in the *client-server* architecture as a means of sending and receiving data.

Either, in the body of a request or the body of the response.

JSON is based in Javascript. It stands for JavaScript Object Notation.

Even though it is based in Javascript, you can use any programming language to write JSON or to parse it.

## Why JSON

One of the main reasons for its success is the simplicity and readability.

For the computers it is also very easy to parse and write.

It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. 

## Example of JSON

A collection of name/value pairs.

```json
{
  "answer": "yes",
  "forced": false,
  "image": "https://yesno.wtf/assets/yes/2.gif"
}
```
