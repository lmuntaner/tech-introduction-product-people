# URL

## Definition

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locators.

It is the human form of the address of a server in the Internet.

## Parts

Practically, the URL has more information that just the address of the server.

It can be used to send specific information or to specify what does the client want specifically from the server.

Please go ahead and read the article explaining the parts of a URL by MDN in [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL).

I can't do a better job at explaining them.
